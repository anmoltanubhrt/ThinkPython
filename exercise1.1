1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses or both? 

If in a print statement, one of the parantheses is left out, the following happens - 

Syntax Errr : Unexpected EOF while parsing

If both the parantheses are left out, 

SyntaxError: invalid syntax 

2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out of the quotation marks, or both?

The following error occurs -
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal 

3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?

There is no issue. The code does not produces any error, rather sums out to be 4.

4. In math notation, leading zeroes are okay, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?
Python does not understands it as a numeric value and produces error!

5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?
The values are considered as string
