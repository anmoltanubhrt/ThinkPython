Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator. 
1. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
def second_calculator(time):
    time = time.split(" ")
    time_seconds = int(time[0])*3600 + int(time[2])
    print(time_seconds)
second_calculator('42 minutes 42 seconds')

2. How many miles are there in 10 kilometers?
def miles_km(km):
    km = int(km) *1.61
    return km
print(miles_km(12))

3. If you run a 10 km race in 42 minutes and 42 second, what is your average pace? what is yoru average sped in miles per hour?

def miles_km(km):
    km = int(km) *1.61
    return km
    
def second_calculator(time):
    time = time.split(" ")
    time_seconds = int(time[0]) + int(time[2])/3600
    print(miles_km(10)/time_seconds)
second_calculator('42 minutes 42 seconds')
